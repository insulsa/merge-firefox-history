SYNOPSIS:
merge-firefox-history <db1> <db2>

DESCRIPTION:
<db1>  and  <db2>  are  sqlite3  databases,  usually  located  as
"places.sqlite".  many records from <db2> are appended to  <db1>.
<db1>  IS TO BE MODIFIED. Make back‚Äêup before use. <db2> is read-
only.  Layout of the firefox places database is described in
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/Database

DEPENDENCIES:
sqlite3(1)

BUGS:
1.  moz_places[disabled,  typed,  frecency,  last_visit_date] and
moz_historyvisits[visit_type,session] are wrongly assigned.
2.  Colliding  moz_places[url]  from  <db2> are appended to <db1>
with moz_places[id] offset. I  believe  they are to  be  combined
with frecency arithmetics.
3. No proper handling errors.

HISTORY:
This programme is tested with the following builds of firefox:
debian iceweasel 31.6.0 (previous, I no longer install this version)
debian firefox-esr 45.3.0esr-1 (current)
